# Document Statistics
The purpose of this project is to perform document analysis for text document.  The system will read in a text file and perform the following analysis:	
* Histogram of the characters in the file – calculate the number of times each character appears in the document.	
* Alphabetical list of the words in the file – create an alphabetized dictionary of each word that appears in the document. 	
* Histogram of the words in the file – calculate the number of times each word appears in the document.	
* The top three – three word sequences in the file – identify the three word phases that appear the most often in the text file and show the top three phrases and the number of times they appear in the document.
